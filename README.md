## Introduction

In the fast-paced digital age, the Flight Booking System provides a modern and minimal solution to traditional ticketing systems. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this application allows users to search for and book flights efficiently. A key enhancement is the integration of a **queue mechanism** to ensure fair processing of booking requests, especially under load.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in securely.
- **Flight Search and Booking**: Search for flights based on source, destination, and date, and book them using a queue-backed system.
- **Queue-Based Booking**: Ensures orderly and conflict-free ticket processing under simultaneous user requests.
- **Responsive Design**: Offers a consistent experience across desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

> âœ¨ Note: QR code verification, admin panel, and payment integration have been removed in this version for simplicity and to focus solely on the booking system.
